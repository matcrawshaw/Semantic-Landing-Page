# Week-1-Challenge

The challenge was to make the website landing page more accessable using semantic HTML while still maintaining original layout.

There was also 'alt' tags added to the images describing them, and notes added along the HTML file to clearly show what each section is for.

I also cleaned up the CSS classes and consolidated where possible in order to clean up the code.

Thanks for your time.
