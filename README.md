# Week-1-Challenge

The challenge was to make the website landing page more accessable using semantic HTML while still maintaining original layout.

'alt' tags have been added to the images for screen reader accessibility, and notes added along the HTML file to clearly show what each section is for.

I also cleaned up the CSS classes, removing duplication and consolidating where possible in order to clean up the code.
